# ms-auth

## :information_source: Information 

Development of two authentication projects in microservices, using two models: stateful and stateless. Auth represents an authentication API. Any represents any API, which will only have to validate the access token. The operating model of the applications will be shown below.

## Stateless vs Stateful

This table highlights the key differences between stateless and stateful systems:

| **Stateless**        | **Stateful**        |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| No session           | Session-based       |
| No login             | Login functionality |
| No basket            | Basket functionality|
| Static content       | Dynamic content     |

---

Stateless systems are typically simpler and scale better, but stateful systems are more suitable for interactive and personalized applications.

## üî® Docker

Before cloning the project, you will need to install docker on your operating system.

For windows, enter the following from the link:

```
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
```

For linux, follow the procedure below:
- Update your existing list of packages:

```
sudo apt update
```

- Install some prerequisite packages that let apt use packages over HTTPS:

```
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

```

- Add the GPG key to the official Docker repository on your system:

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
- Add the Docker repository to the APT sources:

```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"

```

- Update the package database with Docker packages from the newly added repository:

```
sudo apt update
```

- Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repository instead of the default Ubuntu repository:

```
apt-cache policy docker-ce
```

- Install Docker:

```
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

- Check if it is working:

```
sudo systemctl status docker
```


After cloning the project, perform the following
Enter the services folder, then enter the v2 folder and run the following command:

```
docker-compose up   
```
